"""The shop's catalogue, taken from the warehouse's items.

Everything the shop sells is an item the warehouse holds: same SKU, same
description, same category code, and the same QR printed on its tag. This module
keeps the two in step, so a garment scanned at the counter resolves to the record
the GRN created upstairs instead of something re-typed into the till.

**Read-only.** The warehouse database is opened `mode=ro` and never written. It is
the system of record for what stock exists and where it came from; a till is not
the place to amend that.

**Stock is not copied.** `products.stock_qty` here is what the SHOP holds — put
there by a Stock Outward to the store, or by hand — and a sync leaves it alone.
Copying the warehouse's holding would tell a cashier they can sell forty pieces
sitting in a box across town. What is copied is what identifies and prices an
item: sku, description, the attribute tuple, HSN, uom, MRP/sale price, average
cost, its category, and the QR payload printed on its label.

**Scanning.** `resolve_scan()` is the one entry point every scan point uses — the
billing counter, the floor app, and inventory's scan-to-add. It accepts a shop
SKU, a printed barcode, a warehouse QR payload (`E1|…` for a SKU tag, `EU1|…` for
a single garment), or a bare per-piece code, and returns the shop product. An item
the warehouse has but the shop hasn't seen yet is imported on the spot, so a tag
that exists is never a tag that fails to scan.
