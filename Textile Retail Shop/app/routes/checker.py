"""Stock check — where is this item, and have we got it.

Two questions, one screen. With the garment in your hand: scan it and get the
whole picture — what the shop holds, what the warehouse still holds, the piece
codes behind it, and every bill it has gone out on. With the customer in front of
you asking for a medium in black: filter by attribute and price and see what
comes back.

The shop is the only side that can answer both. It keeps its own stock and its
own invoices, and it reads the warehouse database read-only through
warehouse_items — the backend has no route the other way.

One honest limit, worth knowing before trusting a screen like this: per-piece
codes are only ever created `in_stock` and nothing marks one sold, because a sale
takes a SKU and a quantity, not a piece. So the pieces listed are the ones the
warehouse minted, not proof that each is still on a shelf, and sales history is
answered per product rather than per garment.
