"""Ask the shop a question — "what did we sell last month", "நிலுவை எவ்வளவு".

ROUTING, NOT TEXT-TO-SQL
------------------------
The model's job here is narrow and checkable: pick one of the reports in
reports_lib and say what dates it wants. It never writes a query. That matters
for the same reason it matters upstairs in the warehouse — each report already
knows what it counts, and says in its `note` where the honest figure differs from
the obvious one (that returns come off the seller, that stock value is at cost,
that walk-ins have no customer to name). A generated query knows the columns and
none of that: it would return a number that looks right, disagrees with the same
figure on the Reports screen, and leaves nobody able to say which is wrong.

`report_key` is an enum in the output schema, built from REPORTS itself, so an
unknown report is not something the model can return and the two cannot drift
apart. Dates come back as ISO and are re-parsed here rather than trusted.

The reading — which report, which dates — is always shown back to the user in one
line, so a misroute is caught before the figures are believed.

WITHOUT AN API KEY
------------------
It still works, by scoring the question against each report's keywords and
resolving relative dates itself. That is visibly worse — it is matching words,
not reading a sentence — so it says so in `engine` rather than passing itself off
as the same thing.

- Pick the report that answers the question most directly.
- Questions may be in English or Tamil. Answer the same either way.
- `date_from`/`date_to` are ISO dates. Work out relative periods ("last month",
  "this week", "yesterday", "கடந்த மாதம்") against today's date.
- Reports marked (undated) show the position right now; give them today's date
  for both ends.
- If no report really answers it, still pick the closest and set confidence low.
- `reading` is one short sentence, in the question's own language, saying what
