"""Stock the warehouse sent here, taken into the branch it was sent to.

The warehouse dispatches goods to a place by name — Stock Outward, to "TAQUA
SILKS, TIRUPUR" — and posting that reduces the warehouse's own stock. Until now
nothing picked it up at the other end: the pieces left one system and arrived in
none. A shop's count was whatever it had when its items were first imported, plus
whatever somebody typed since.

So the transfers are read, and what was ACCEPTED at the far end becomes stock at
that branch. Accepted, not sent: the warehouse already records the difference as
a transfer discrepancy, and a shop that took in the sent figure would be holding
pieces that never came off the lorry.

WHAT MAKES THIS SAFE TO RUN AGAIN. Every applied line is written down by the
warehouse's own line id (models.TransferReceipt, unique), and a line already
written down is skipped. Without that, every restart would add the whole delivery
again — and a stock figure that grows when you restart the till is the kind of
bug that is believed for weeks, because nobody watches a number that only moves
upward when they are not looking.

TWO FIGURES, KEPT IN STEP. `Product.stock_qty` stays what the shop holds
altogether — it is what the till sells against and what every existing screen
reads. `LocationStock` is the split of it: what is at each branch. Both are moved
together here. They are not derived from each other, because a shop whose
branches were stocked before any of this existed has a total and no split, and
dividing one to invent the other would be making up numbers about real goods.

Read-only towards the warehouse, like everything else the shop reads of it.
