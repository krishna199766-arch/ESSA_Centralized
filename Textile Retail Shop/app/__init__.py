# Which Postgres schema the shop's tables live in.

# Standalone — the shop on its own SQLite file — this is unset and nothing
# changes: SQLite has no schemas and never needed one, because a file each kept
# the two applications apart.
#
# Mounted inside the warehouse on ONE Postgres, it is set to "shop", and it has
# to be, because five table names are the same in both codebases: categories,
# floors, products, stock_movements and users. Whichever application creates a name first
# wins it, and the other then queries a table with its own name and the wrong
# columns — "column categories.description does not exist", on a table that
# plainly does exist.
#
# Naming the schema on the METADATA is what makes that hold. It puts the schema
# in the SQL — `SELECT ... FROM shop.categories` — rather than in the session,
# and session state is exactly what a transaction-mode connection pooler does not
# keep. The earlier fix set search_path through the connection URL's `options`
# parameter, which works on a direct connection and is silently dropped by
# PgBouncer, which is what the deployment runs on. The schema in the statement
# needs nothing from the connection.

    """Let two tills bill at the same moment on SQLite.

    A shop with counters on four floors has four processes' worth of writes
    landing on one file, and SQLite's defaults are wrong for that in two ways:

    **Journal mode.** In the default rollback journal, a reader blocks a writer
    and a writer blocks readers — so a cashier scanning a garment can stall
    another cashier's checkout, and a transaction that has read something and
    then tries to write gets SQLITE_BUSY *immediately*, without waiting, to avoid
    a deadlock. Write-ahead logging removes that: readers never block the writer
    and the writer never blocks readers. `journal_mode` is a property of the FILE
    and persists, so it is set once here rather than per connection.

    **Busy timeout.** Two writers still take turns, and the default is to fail
    instantly rather than take a turn. The wait is set in config
    (SQLALCHEMY_ENGINE_OPTIONS), because pysqlite takes it as a connection
    argument.

    Only ever applied to the SHOP's own database. The warehouse's SQLite file is
    somebody else's, and this shop only reads it — turning on WAL there would
    change a file this application does not own, and leave -wal and -shm files
    beside it for the warehouse to be surprised by.

    **Starting a billing transaction as a writer.** This is the one that actually
    cost a sale. A transaction that READS and then tries to WRITE has to upgrade
    its lock, and if any other connection has committed in between, SQLite
    refuses the upgrade *immediately* — the busy timeout is deliberately not
    consulted, because waiting could deadlock. Taking the next bill number is
    exactly that shape: look up the series, then increment it. Measured under
    twenty simultaneous bills it failed one in five with "database is locked",
    and no retry inside the transaction can fix it — the retry re-reads the same
    stale snapshot and fails the same way.

    So a request that is going to take a bill number opens with BEGIN IMMEDIATE
    and holds the write lock from the start. There is then nothing to upgrade,
    and a second till WAITS (that timeout again) instead of failing.

    Only those requests. Every other transaction begins deferred, exactly as it
    always has, because BEGIN IMMEDIATE on all of them would put every scan,
    every report and — worst — the ask bar's wait on an external model behind the
    same lock as the tills. Making a manager's question block the counter would
    be a worse bug than the one being fixed.

    Postgres needs none of this: it has real row-level locking, so the second
    till simply waits on the row and no lock is ever upgraded. The flag is set
    regardless and does nothing there.

    Never fatal. A database that will not take the pragma still runs the shop;
    it just serialises the way it always did.
