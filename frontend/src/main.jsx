// So finding ourselves inside one means a request for a POS screen came back as
// the warehouse instead — a routing rule that missed, a login redirect that lost
// its prefix. Rendering anyway is what turned that into three stacked copies of
// the header: the app draws its own POS frame, which asks for a POS screen, which
// comes back as the app, which draws another frame. The browser gives up after a
// few and leaves a page that looks like a display bug rather than a wrong answer
// from the server.
//
// Refusing to mount stops it at the first one and says what actually happened,
// which is the difference between a fault somebody can act on and a fault that
// looks like CSS.
