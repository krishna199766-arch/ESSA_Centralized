"""Physical Stock Audit — the counted stocktake, over HTTP.

One screen, so the endpoints are shaped for one screen: the filter panel asks
`/options` for what it may offer and `/preview` for how much a filter set would
cover, the grid asks `/{id}` for its rows, and everything that changes a count
takes the count's id. Nothing here moves stock except `/apply`, which needs an
approved count and a change reason before it will.

See services/physical_audit for why a count is not an adjustment, and why this
is a second audit rather than a bigger version of the scan-through next door.
