"""Purchase Orders — the buying desk's register.

The order is the first document in the chain and, until now, the one the system
did not have. See services/purchase_orders for the lifecycle and why editing
stops at `confirmed`.

Shaped like the LR router next door on purpose: a list narrowed by the warehouse
the call is made inside, a manual create, a PATCH that refuses once the document
is committed, and status moves as their own routes rather than a writable
`status` field. A status that can be PATCHed is a status whose rules can be
skipped by anyone who sends the right JSON.
