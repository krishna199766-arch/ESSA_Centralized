"""
User management — the super admin's screen.

Reachable only by a super admin; that is enforced in security.POLICY, not here,
so this file is about the rules that are specific to accounts rather than about
who may open it.

Those rules exist to stop the two ways an install locks itself out. A super
admin may not demote, deactivate or delete themselves — the account you are
signed in as is the one holding the door open. And the last active super admin
may not be removed by any route, even by another super admin, because the
screen that would fix the mistake is the one that just became unreachable.
