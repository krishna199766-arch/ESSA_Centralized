"""Dead Stock & Clearance — the register, the ladder, the campaigns.

Five screens are served from here and they are all the same read: the dashboard
is the register totalled, the summary is it grouped, the cash impact is it
valued, and the alerts are it counted at three thresholds. Only the campaigns
write anything, and what they write is a plan — never stock. See
services/dead_stock.py for why that boundary is where it is.
