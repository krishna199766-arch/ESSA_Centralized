"""
Signing in, from the desktop app and from the phone.

Credentials are checked against the users table (see services/users); the reply
carries a signed token the apps keep in localStorage and send back as a header.
The same token is also set as a cookie, which is not redundant: an <img> tag
pointing at an invoice scan, or a label preview opened in a new tab, cannot send
a header, and those requests are policed like every other one.
