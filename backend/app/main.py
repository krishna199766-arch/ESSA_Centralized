# Why the schema build is allowed to fail here
# ---------------------------------------------
# On the warehouse PC this is a SQLite file that is always reachable, and a
# failure means something is badly wrong and crashing is the honest response.
# Deployed, the database is across a network and behind a connection string
# somebody typed. A raise at import time there does not produce a message
# anybody sees — the whole module fails to import, and the platform answers
# every request with an opaque FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED. The reason is in a
# log the person debugging has to know to go and find.
#
# So the failure is recorded instead of raised, and /api/status reports it. The
# deployment is just as unusable either way; the difference is that this one
# says what is wrong with it.
