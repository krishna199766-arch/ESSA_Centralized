"""
Mutable runtime settings — the vision API key and model, the provider
preference, and the dead-stock discount ladder. All changed from the UI, all
expected to survive a restart.

Source of truth precedence: what somebody saved in the app wins; otherwise the
environment defaults in config.py.

Those saved values live in the `app_settings` table, not in a JSON file beside
the database as they used to. The file worked while there was always one server
with a disk, and stopped working the moment there might not be:

  * a read-only filesystem has nowhere to write it, and
  * module-level state is per-process, so on a deployment that runs several
    short-lived instances the key saved by whichever one served the settings
    screen is not there for the one that serves the next upload. Vision would
    look like it switched itself off at random, which is a hard fault to chase.

A row is one answer for every instance. An existing settings.json is imported
once, so a laptop that has been running for months keeps the key it already had.
