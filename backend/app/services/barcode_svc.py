"""
QR + label service.

A product has ONE identifier of ours: the `sku` (ESSA-00001). It is what the SKU
column shows, what prints under the QR on a label, and what a scan resolves to.

`Product.barcode` still exists but is no longer ours to issue. It holds the code
the SUPPLIER printed, when they print one, so `inventory.match_product` can key a
re-buy onto the product it already created — which is what stops one item's
weighted-average cost splitting across two records. It is never presented as this
product's code, and nothing generates it. We used to mint an internal EAN-13 there
so the label could carry a 1D stripe; once the label went QR-only that second
number bought nothing and gave two answers to "what is this product's code".

Labels and the Inventory list are QR-only:

  * QR — carries the whole product record (see qr_payload), so a phone camera or
    2D imager gets every attribute in one scan, and still works with no network.
    Owning the label alone lets it print bigger, which is what makes it scan
    first time in warehouse light.

The trade-off this accepts: a pure 1D laser handheld cannot read a 2D code at
all, so scanners that aren't 2D imagers can only be used by keying in the printed
SKU. `barcode_svg` is kept (and still served at /barcode.svg) for anyone who
needs a stripe back — it renders whatever code it is handed.

The QR payload is compact JSON, not a URL: a URL would need the server reachable
and would carry no attributes of its own. Scanning resolves the embedded `sku`
against the live database so details are always current, and falls back to the
attributes baked into the code when offline — which is the point of putting them
there. `parse_qr_payload` + `resolve` accept a scanned payload anywhere a bare
code is accepted, so nothing downstream needs to know which symbology was used.
