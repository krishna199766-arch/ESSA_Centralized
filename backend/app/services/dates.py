"""
One date format, everywhere: ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`.

Dates arrive in this system in whatever form the page they came from used. A
supplier prints 31/07/2026, a register page is written 31-7-26, an e-invoice
carries 2026-07-31, and a human types whatever they type. They were all stored
verbatim, and that quietly broke three things:

  * **Range search.** `GET /api/lr/search?date_from=` compares in SQL — a plain
    string comparison on `recv_date`. That is only correct on ISO text: with
    "31/07/2026" in the column, "01/08/2026" sorts *before* it and a July–August
    filter returns the wrong rows. No error, just a shorter list than the truth.
  * **Conflict detection.** `lr_link` flags a register row whose invoice date
    disagrees with the linked invoice. Two spellings of the same day compared as
    text disagree, so a correct pairing gets reported as a mismatch.
  * **Ageing.** `payments._parse_date` knows three formats; anything else falls to
    None and the bill silently loses its "days outstanding".

So dates are normalised as they are written. Anything readable becomes ISO;
anything unreadable is **left exactly as it came** rather than dropped, because a
date this module cannot parse is still evidence of what was on the page, and
silently blanking a supplier's own figure is worse than storing it oddly.

AMBIGUITY: 03/04/2026 is the 3rd of April here, not the 4th of March. Every
supplier and register in this business writes day-first, and the reference
recordings are Indian. Where the first number is above 12 the reading is forced
anyway; where a year appears first the order is unambiguous. Only genuinely
ambiguous day/month pairs use the day-first assumption, and that assumption is
stated here rather than buried in a format list.
