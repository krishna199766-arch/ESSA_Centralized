"""Purchase orders — what we asked for, before anything arrived.

WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. Intake began at the supplier's invoice, so the system
knew what turned up and what it cost but never what was ordered. That gap is why
"Invoice Vs Purchase Order" is one of the six reports the catalogue lists as
absent rather than empty, and why receiving could never be three-way matched.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE. No stock moves, no valuation, no tax arithmetic.
An order is a statement of intent: it is raised by us, it names a price we were
quoted, and until goods arrive against it nothing in the ledger has happened.
Everything that touches stock stays where it already is — services/inventory.

THE LIFECYCLE IS THE FEATURE:

    draft ──▶ pending ──▶ confirmed
      │          │            │
      └──────────┴────────────┴──▶ cancelled

`draft` is being written. `pending` has gone to the supplier and is awaiting
their word. `confirmed` is agreed by both sides — and is the ONLY state goods
may be received against, which is what makes "no LR without a confirmed PO"
expressible instead of being a convention someone has to remember.

EDITING STOPS AT CONFIRMED. A confirmed order is what the supplier agreed to; if
it could still be edited then the LR guard would be checking a document that no
longer says what it said when it was confirmed. Amending one means cancelling it
and raising its replacement, which is also what leaves an audit trail.
