"""Working INSIDE one warehouse.

WHAT THIS IS FOR. Stock is split by warehouse (services/stock_locations), but
the SCREENS were not: Erode's receiving clerk opened the GRN list and saw
Karur's drafts, the invoice queue held every branch's bills, and the transport
register was one long list nobody could find their own lorry in. Splitting the
ledger made the numbers right; this makes the day's work right.

HOW THE WAREHOUSE TRAVELS. As a request header, `X-Essa-Warehouse`, set once by
the client for every call it makes (see frontend/src/api.js). Not as a parameter
threaded through fifty call sites, because the failure mode there is one screen
that forgets — and a screen that forgets does not look broken, it looks like
another warehouse's work has appeared in yours. A header cannot be forgotten by
one screen at a time.

`?warehouse_id=` is still honoured, for a link somebody pastes and for the
central dashboard, which asks about a warehouse it is not inside.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT SCOPED. Three kinds of record:

  * **Owns a warehouse** — Purchase, StockOutward, Document, LREntry. Filtered on
    their own column.
  * **Derives one** — a debit note belongs to the warehouse its GRN received
    into; a carton belongs to the receipt that made it; a product is "here" if
    this warehouse holds any of it. Filtered through the row that knows.
  * **Company-wide** — suppliers, masters, catalogues, label templates, users,
    and SUPPLIER PAYMENTS. A payment is deliberately not scoped: one cheque
    settles bills from two warehouses, and splitting the ledger by building
    would make the supplier's account impossible to reconcile.

UNASSIGNED ROWS STAY VISIBLE. Anything written before workspaces existed has no
warehouse, and it is shown inside every one rather than being hidden until
somebody claims it. An invoice that has vanished from all queues is an invoice
that goes unpaid; a duplicate on two screens is merely untidy, and it stops as
soon as it is filed.
