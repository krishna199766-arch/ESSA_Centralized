"""Per-screen access: what one account may VIEW, CREATE, MODIFY, DELETE and PRINT.

Roles answer "how much of this app is yours" in three steps, and three steps is
not enough for a warehouse. A receiving clerk needs the GRN screen but must not
post a return; a stock auditor needs to read every screen and change none of
them. Both of those are inside one role today, so the only way to express them
was to hand out the whole role.

So a user may carry a GRANT MAP on top of their role: screen → the actions they
have on it. Two rules make it safe to add to a system that has been running
without it:

  * **The role is still the ceiling.** A grant cannot reach past it. Ticking
    Reports for a floor user does not open Reports — `security.POLICY` still
    says Reports is admin, and it is still the thing that refuses. This keeps
    one answer to "what is dangerous", and it means a mis-tick cannot escalate
    anybody.
  * **No map means no narrowing.** A user with nothing recorded behaves exactly
    as they did before — their role decides, as it always has. Existing accounts
    are therefore untouched until somebody deliberately restricts one, and an
    empty map is never mistaken for "denied everything", which would lock the
    warehouse out of its own app on the morning of an upgrade.

The screens are the app's own modules, and the paths that serve them are already
enumerated once, in `security.POLICY`. They are not enumerated a second time
here: a table of path→screen kept beside a table of path→role is two tables that
drift, and the drift is silent and is a security hole. POLICY carries the screen.
