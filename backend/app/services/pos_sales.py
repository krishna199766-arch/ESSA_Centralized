"""What the shop has sold, read from the shop's own database.

The till is a separate Flask application with its own SQLite file (see
pos_mount.py). It already opens OUR database `mode=ro` to build its catalogue —
this is the mirror of that arrangement and obeys the same rule: read-only, never
written. The shop is the system of record for what was sold, exactly as the
warehouse is for what exists, and a report is not a reason to reach into another
application's tables with a pen.

`products.warehouse_id` in the shop is the join. Everything the shop sells came
from a warehouse item and carries our product id (the shop's
app/warehouse_items.py puts it there); anything the shop added on its own has
none and is invisible here — correctly, because the warehouse holds no stock of
it.

Returns are netted off. A kurti sold and brought back on a credit note is not a
kurti that sold, and counting it as one would keep a genuinely dead line looking
alive on the strength of a sale that was undone.

Every failure degrades to "no sales known" rather than raising: the shop may not
be installed beside us, may never have been opened, or may be locked mid-write.
A dead-stock report that refuses to open because the till is switched off is
worse than one that answers from the warehouse's own ledger and says so — which
is why `available()` is part of the answer and every caller reports it.

#  This used to be a file path and nothing else: sqlite3 opened
#  "Textile Retail Shop/textile_shop.db" read-only, because both halves lived in
#  one folder on one PC. Deployed, they do not. The shop is mounted INTO this
#  process and put in the `shop` SCHEMA of the same Postgres database (see
#  app/pos_mount._isolate_shop_schema) — there is no file at all. So `available()`
#  answered False, and Dead Stock and the Item Locator reported "the shop is not
#  installed" while the till was billing in the same process.
#
#  Worse than blind: WRONG. A machine pointed at Postgres through DATABASE_URL
#  usually still has the old local textile_shop.db lying beside the code, so this
#  module read it and presented months-old local sales as live figures. A screen
#  that says nothing is recoverable; a screen that says the wrong number is not.
#
#  So the target is chosen the way the shop chooses ITS target when reading back
#  the other way (Textile Retail Shop/app/warehouse_items.warehouse_url): ask the
#  configured database first, and fall back to the file only when this really is
#  a SQLite install.
