"""
Stock Outward / Stock Inward service — the two ends of one transfer.

build:    create a draft outward, resolving each scanned code / product to an
          inventory product (so the screen can show the full record — QR, name,
          size, colour, batch — before anything is packed).
post:     append one negative StockMovement per line (kind='outward') and reduce
          each product's stock. Guards against dispatching more than on hand.
          Idempotent — an outward posts once.
receive:  the STOCK INWARD side. The destination counts what turned up and
          accepts it, line by line, against the same document. Accepted qty
          defaults to the sent qty; anything less is a transfer discrepancy,
          recorded rather than silently absorbed.

Mirrors the app's pair of screens (Warehouse / Stock Outward → Store / Stock
Inward, which prints a Goods Transfer note): From company/location, Packed By, a
To destination, Received By, and a sent vs accepted qty per line.

    Accepting fewer than were sent is recorded, NOT corrected: the stock has
    already left this warehouse, and where the missing pieces are (in transit,
