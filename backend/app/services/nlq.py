"""
Natural-language report queries — "ask the warehouse a question".

Someone types "how much did we buy from AMS Garments last month" or
"கடந்த மாதம் வாங்கிய பொருட்கள்" and gets the right report, already filtered.

WHY THIS ROUTES INSTEAD OF WRITING SQL
--------------------------------------
The obvious build is text-to-SQL: hand the model the schema and run what it
writes. This does not do that, and the reason is not squeamishness about
generated SQL — it is that the answer would be worse.

`services/reports.py` already holds 33 curated reports. Each one knows what it
is counting and, where the honest figure differs from the obvious one, says so
in its `note` — that only stock traceable to a posted GRN is stock, that a
broken-down bundle received its variants rather than itself, that a shortage is
claimable until waived. A generated query knows the columns and none of that. It
would return a number that looks right, disagrees with the same figure on the
Inventory screen, and gives nobody a way to tell which is wrong.

So the model's job here is narrow and checkable: pick one of the 33 reports and
fill in its filters. That has three consequences worth having — the answer comes
back in the same {columns, rows, totals, note} shape the screen and the CSV
export already render, an arbitrary question cannot touch the database in any way
the Reports screen could not already, and the reading is small enough to show the
user in one line so they can catch a misread before trusting the figures.

WHAT THE MODEL CANNOT GET WRONG
-------------------------------
`report_key` is an `enum` in the structured-output schema, so an unknown report
is not a thing the model can return — no validation branch, no 404 path. Dates
come back as ISO and are still re-parsed through services/dates.py, because a
plausible-looking date is exactly the kind of thing to check rather than trust.

FILTERS THE REPORTS DO NOT HAVE
-------------------------------
Only `stock_movement` accepts a product or a movement kind, roughly half accept a
date range, and **nothing accepts a supplier**. So "purchases from AMS Garments"
routed to the Purchase Report would return every supplier's purchases, and
labelling that with the question would be a lie.

Two things happen instead. Routing prefers a report that can honour the filters
the question implies. Then anything left over is applied by narrowing the rows
after the report runs (`_narrow`), which is reported as a separate step and never
silently folded into "here is your answer".

WITHOUT AN API KEY
------------------
Vision is optional in this app and so is this. `_offline()` scores the question
against each report's keywords and resolves relative dates itself. It is visibly
worse — it is matching words, not reading a sentence — so it says so in the
`engine` field rather than presenting itself as the same feature.

The question may be in English or Tamil, or mix the two. Read either.

REPORTS (key | name (group) | filters it accepts | what it answers):
{catalogue}

RULES
1. Pick the single report that best answers the question. Use its exact key.
2. Prefer a report that ACCEPTS the filters the question implies. If the question
   restricts a date range, prefer a report whose filters include date_from and
   date_to over one that takes none — a report that cannot filter by date will
   return every period.
3. If no report answers the question, return "{no_match}" and say what was asked
   for in `reading`. Do not force a loose match. A wrong report is worse than
   an honest miss, because the person will read its numbers as their answer.
4. Dates: resolve every relative phrase against TODAY and return ISO YYYY-MM-DD.
   "last month", "கடந்த மாதம்" and "August" all become a concrete from/to.
   `as_on` is a single date and only for stock_as_on.
5. `kind` is only for stock_movement and must be one of: {kinds}.
6. `supplier_name` is the supplier as the person named them — do not correct
   spelling or expand it; it gets matched against the supplier master separately.
   `product_query` likewise for a product, SKU or barcode.
7. `reading` is one short plain-English line stating how you read the question,
   shown to the person so they can catch a misread. Name the report, the period
   and any supplier. Never claim a filter you did not set.
8. Leave any field that does not apply as an empty string.

TODAY is {today}."""
