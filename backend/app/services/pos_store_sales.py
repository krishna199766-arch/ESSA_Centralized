"""What each SHOP sold — read from the till's own database, grouped by branch.

services/pos_sales.py answers "what has this warehouse ITEM sold", which is what
dead stock and the item locator ask. This answers the other question: "what did
this BRANCH take", which is what a consolidated dashboard asks. Same wall, same
read-only rule, same transport (pos_sales owns it) — a different GROUP BY.

THE JOIN BACK TO A WAREHOUSE IS BY NAME, and that is not a shortcut. The shop
keeps its own `locations` table and syncs it from ours by name, case-insensitively
(see the shop's app/places.sync_locations and services/locations.mirror_to_options);
`Store.name` is unique company-wide precisely so it can be the join key. There is
no id shared across the two databases to use instead.

So a branch whose name does not match any store of ours is NOT silently dropped
and NOT silently attributed: it comes back under `unmatched`, with its money, and
the caller shows it. A figure that vanishes because two spellings drifted apart is
the failure this arrangement is most prone to, and the only defence is to say so.

Bills with no branch at all — raised before the till had counters — are reported
separately again, as `unplaced`. They are real money and they belong to no store.
