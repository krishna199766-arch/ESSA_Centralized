GRN + inventory service — turns a confirmed extraction into stock.

Two phases, deliberately separated so a human can review before stock moves:

  build_grn_from_document(doc)  -> a DRAFT Purchase whose lines are matched to
                                   existing Products (by barcode, else by

                                   are flagged is_new_product.

  post_grn(purchase)            -> creates the new Products, appends one inward
                                   StockMovement per line, and updates each
                                   product's stock_qty + weighted-average cost.
                                   Idempotent: a purchase can only post once.

Weighted-average cost keeps valuation stable across purchases at different rates:
