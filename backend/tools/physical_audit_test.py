"""Counting a warehouse by quantity: the variance, and the gate in front of it.

    python backend/tools/physical_audit_test.py

The properties here are the ones that would be wrong silently — a count that
looks finished and is not, a correction that runs twice, a filter that quietly
stops filtering:

  * **The filters define the count, and are kept.** A count opened over one
    brand covers that brand's items and no others, and what was being counted is
    on the header afterwards. Without that, last month's count of the MENS rack
    reads as a count of the building and reports every other rack as missing.
  * **Null is not zero.** "Nobody has been to this rack" and "the rack is empty"
    are different findings, and only the first may be left out of an adjustment.
  * **The book figure is frozen.** A line carries what the ledger said when it
    was made. Re-reading it as the screen draws would make every line agree with
    itself and the variance would always be nought.
  * **Counting moves no stock.** Not on a scan, not on a typed count, not on
    completion, not on approval. Only `apply` moves stock, only after approval,
    only with a reason, and only once.
  * **Scanning adds, typing replaces, uploading replaces.** Three verbs that
    look alike. A gun read twice is two garments; a file run twice is not two
    warehouses.

Runs against a throwaway SQLite file; nothing here touches the real database.
