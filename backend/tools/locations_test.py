"""A location's own identity: address, contact and registration, at all three levels.

    python backend/tools/locations_test.py

A warehouse, a store and a counter each PRINT. A GRN is received at one, a
transfer note is addressed to the next, a retail bill comes off the third — and
what has to appear at the head of each is that place's own address and its own
GST number, because a branch registered separately has a different one from the
warehouse supplying it. So all three carry the same field set (see
models.LocationProfile) and this checks that they really all do, rather than the
warehouse carrying it and the other two quietly dropping it on save.

Four things are easy to break here and are checked directly:

  * a field that saves on one level and is dropped on another. One writer feeds
    all three from services.locations.PROFILE_FIELDS; a level that stopped using
    it would still return 200 and simply lose what was typed.
  * the GST state code disagreeing with the GSTIN. It is DERIVED from the first
    two digits rather than typed, because two fields that must agree and are
    both typed by hand disagree eventually — and this one decides whether a sale
    is inter-state.
  * a partial PATCH wiping what it did not mention. The close-a-branch button
    sends {name, active} and nothing else. If "not mentioned" were read as
    "clear it", closing a store for the weekend would erase its address.
  * an empty string NOT clearing. It is the other half of the same rule: the
    form sends "" for a box somebody deliberately emptied, and that has to
    reach the column.

Runs against a throwaway SQLite file; nothing here touches the real database.
