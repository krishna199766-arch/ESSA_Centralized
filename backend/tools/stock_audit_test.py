"""Counting the shelf: what a scan concludes, and what it refuses to conclude.

    python backend/tools/stock_audit_test.py

Four properties, each of which would be wrong in a way nobody would notice:

  * **Three results, not two.** A code that resolves to nothing is a master-data
    problem; a product with no stock is a shelf problem. The screen shows two
    colours, but collapsing the two findings in the DATA would send somebody to
    look for stock that never existed.
  * **A re-scan does not double-count.** One row per code per session. The
    register quietly growing a second row for one garment is the failure a stock
    count exists to prevent.
  * **The figures are frozen at scan time.** `stock_qty` is what the books said
    when the shelf was looked at. Re-deriving it later turns the count into a
    report on today, and destroys the only thing it was for.
  * **Counting never moves stock.** The ledger is changed deliberately, elsewhere,
    with a reason on it — never as a side effect of a phone scanning a label.

Runs against a throwaway SQLite file; nothing here touches the real database.
