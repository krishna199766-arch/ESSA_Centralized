"""A till is closed, then deleted a year later — not deleted on the day.

    python backend/tools/terminal_retention_test.py

A POS terminal is the one place in this hierarchy where deletion cannot be
decided by looking for rows that point at it. Nothing in THIS database does: the
sales belong to the shop, in the shop's own file, and they name the counter by
name. So the server would happily delete a till that billed all last week, and
nothing here would notice — the damage appears a year later, on a screen in a
different application, when a bill is read back and the counter that raised it
cannot be named.

The rule is therefore a date, and this checks the four ways it has to hold:

  * an OPEN till is never deletable, however old it is. This is the case a
    "one year after it was created" rule would have got wrong, and the reason
    the clock starts at closing rather than at creation.
  * a till closed today is refused, and the refusal says WHEN it may go.
  * a till closed over a year ago can be deleted.
  * reopening clears the clock. A counter that came back into use has not been
    retired at all, and must not stay deletable because it happened to be shut
    this time last year.

The screen is fed from the same place — `can_delete` decides whether the cross
is drawn at all — so what it offers and what the server allows cannot drift.

Runs against a throwaway SQLite file; nothing here touches the real database.
