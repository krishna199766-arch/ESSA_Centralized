"""
The whole server, as one Vercel function.

Vercel's Python runtime serves whatever ASGI or WSGI application this module
calls `app`, so this file's only job is to make `backend/` and the shop
importable and then hand over the application that already exists. There is no
second copy of the wiring here: the routers, the access-control middleware, the
phone app at /m and the shop mounted at /pos are all assembled in
backend/app/main.py exactly as they are when the same server runs on the
warehouse PC. One code path, two ways of being started.

Everything under /api, /m and /pos is routed here by the rewrites in
vercel.json; the desktop bundle is served by Vercel itself as static files.
